# SDLR is a listwise L2R

The knowledge distillation framework of SDLR. Both teacher and student models train a Listwise Learning to Rank model, which is dependent on an approximation of the featureâ€™s bandwidths. The teacher model estimates the appropriate bandwidth matrix in an iterative manner.
